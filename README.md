I used some resources to solve the code and just wanted to see and make an approach by a specfic code from:
Work cited:
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/
2. insertion.java file attached as reference


How to Complile in terminal:
gcc -o file2 file2.c
./file2

In this project I am taking an input of length of the array. Once i get a length I am assign a array variable and make a insertion sort formula. After i am running that through i am printing the obtained array.
